# Forecasting Demand for Divvy
 
Background: Divvy, Chicago’s bike-sharing system, was launched in 2013 with the goal of providing a convenient, sustainable, and affordable transportation option for residents and visitors, integrating with the city’s public transit network to improve urban mobility.
Our analysis of Divvy ridership data combined traditional time series models with machine learning to analyze trends and forecast demand, helping Divvy identify patterns in ridership across the network and at specific stations, with the aim of
1) Aligning strategies for bike redistribution with up to date projections for demand leading to:
    a. Improved customer experience from reduced wait times and confidence in availability
    b. Operational efficiency and cost savings from optimized bike redistribution efforts
2) Planning infrastructure changes to stations in key areas
3) Informing pricing & promotion strategies through: 
    a. Understanding the elasticity of demand given changes in pricing 
    b. Potential expansion of the Divvy’s ‘Bike Angels’ program, promoting customer assisted bike redistribution
